                <p>
                    This is Lee. He's the Dad of this family and the initial vision maker. The Quail Garden came out of Lee's desire to become more self sufficient and live in the country. He's the brawn behind the operation - he built all of our coops from recycled wood
                    himself - and does the day-to-day manual labour needed to keep 100 quail, 6 chickens and a dog fit and healthy!

                <h3>Ethics and Standards</h3>
                <p>
                    We care about the way we do business from our accounting to our quail. Although the quail industry is mostly un-regulated we take it upon ourselves to give our quail the best quality of life possible. Once hatched all our quail have ample room to roam
                    and forage around our garden.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of our goals is to be a farm that is environmentally friendly. All of our packaging is made from recycled products and is fully recyclable too! The next big thing to swap are our feeders and drinkers - no more red and white plastic, hello metal! Keep
                    your eye on our page to see future changes!
                </p>
                <p>When you buy local, ethically grown, free to roam eggs you are guaranteed to get the odd few 'wonky' ones! ALL of our eggs make it into our boxes - we don't scrap any - and we like to think they add a touch of character.</p>
                <p>
                    Every box of eggs bought will be funding the dream of a social enterprise that pays a fair wage, supports the vulnerable and enables people to grow in their skills and talents. Will you join the cause?
                </p>
